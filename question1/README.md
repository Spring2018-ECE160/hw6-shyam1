## Question 1

Write a funciton that determines the maximum and minimum values from a one-dimensional array. Assume that the corresponding function prototype statement is

<code>void ranges(int x[], int npts, int *max_ptr, int *min_ptr)</code>

where npts contain the number of values in array x, and max_ptr and min_ptr are pointers to the variables in which to store the maximum and minimum values in the array.

Provide and print out 3 examples to show that your function is working as intended.

Compile Steps: 

Output:
Min: 1 Max: 5
Min: 3 Max: 7
Min: 1 Max: 7
